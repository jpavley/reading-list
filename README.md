# reading-list

Belatedly, I realize there are too many important books left to read and not enough runway left in which to read them. Somehow, I have to accelerate the reading process as it’s 4 hours, 30 minuets, and 35 seconds to midnight in my personal time zone (where 1 hour equals 8.05 years and I assume a generous lifespan of 96 fully operational years).

I’ve wasted too much time on other, less enriching, activities during my prime reading years. One cold fact I’ve learned is that reading is work, not pleasure. Sure, it’s not labor, but it’s not easy. The mark of a good book, fiction or non-fiction, is how it make you think, how it softens your horizons, and how it enables you to change. (The mark of a bad book is how it feels like well-worn road with a smooth ride that lulls you to sleep well with your biases firmly lodged in your brain.)

A really good book (RGB) is painful. It can leave you feeling unmoored in time and space. When I think back to the few really good books, I’ve read I feel giddy. I’m still processing the ramifications of Future Shock by Alvin Toffler 40 years on after I’ve read it. The High Frontier (Gerard O’Neill), The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins), and The Dancing Wi Li Masters (Gary Zukav) are just a handful of science books from the 1970s that have profoundly changed my understanding of how nature works and our place in it. All of these books deserve repeated readings and I’ve only read each one once, when I have very young, and unable to truly appreciate them.

By the way, an RGB may not be well written; Its content may not stand the test of time; Its author may turn out to be a scoundrel. This is all unfortune but comes with the territory. People, being people, are fragile, unreliable vessels for ideas. I believe that once an idea is written down and published in a book the idea becomes property of humanity as whole and lives a life independent of its author. (It is the expression of an idea is that is personal property and copyrightable. I’m not sure if a lawyer would agree with me.)

Finally, RGBs can be hard to recognize in their own time. I’ve listed four books from the 1970s because I’m confident these books have withstood the test of time. As for the books I’ve read recently, and that I’m planning to read, I’m not so sure any of these will become RGBs. I remain hopeful, and grateful to all authors who publish insight that call into question common sense and the status quo.

If you’ve stayed with me to this last paragraph you see my dilemma: Limited time, too many books, and not sure which ones are RGBs. When I have too much to do, I create a prioritized to-do list. And that is what this repo is. It’s really just for me but I welcome your contributions.
