# reading-list

Belatedly, I realize there are too many important books left to read and not enough runway left in which to read them. Somehow, I have to accelerate the reading process as it’s 4 hours, 30 minuets, and 35 seconds to midnight in my personal time zone (where 1 hour equals 8.05 years and I assume a generous lifespan of 96 fully operational years).

I’ve wasted too much time on other, less enriching, activities during my prime reading years. One cold fact I’ve learned is that reading is work, not pleasure. Sure, it’s not labor, but it’s not easy. The mark of a good book, fiction or non-fiction, is how it make you think, how it softens your horizons, and how it enables you to change. (The mark of a bad book is how it feels like well-worn road with a smooth ride that lulls you to sleep well with your biases firmly lodged in your brain.)
